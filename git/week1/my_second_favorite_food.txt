Ingredients:

1 ½ cups crushed graham crackers (or any digestive biscuits)
½ cup melted butter
500g cream cheese (at room temperature)
1 cup sugar
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
Step-by-Step:

Mix the crushed graham crackers with the melted butter until it resembles wet sand. Press this mixture into the base of a springform pan to form the crust.

In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth and creamy. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, and mix well.

Add the eggs one by one, mixing gently until just incorporated. Avoid overbeating to prevent cracks in the cheesecake.

Pour the filling over the crust in the springform pan.

Bake at 160°C (320°F) for 50-60 minutes or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.

Let it cool at room temperature and then refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight) before serving.
